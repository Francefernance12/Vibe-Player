## What Changed

11 files changed, 331 insertions(+), 13 deletions(-)

### Files Modified:
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `client/src/App.tsx` - App component updates
- `client/src/__tests__/SearchBar.test.tsx` - SearchBar test
- `client/src/components/SearchBar.tsx` - SearchBar component
- `client/src/components/SearchResults.tsx` - SearchResults component
- `client/src/types.ts` - TypeScript types
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` - Documentation
- `docs/PLANCHECKLIST.md` - Planning checklist
- `server/src/__tests__/search.test.ts` - Backend search test
- `server/src/app.ts` - Express app
- `server/src/routes/search.ts` - Search route endpoint

### Summary:
- Added Spotify search endpoint with backend route
- Added SearchBar UI component with tests
- Added SearchResults component
- Implemented related TypeScript types

## Issues Spotted

1. **.env file in diff**: The `.env` file shows up in the diff as having changes. This could contain sensitive credentials - verify no secrets are being committed.

2. **Missing error boundary**: The SearchBar component lacks error boundary handling for failed API calls.

## Suggestions

1. **Add environment validation**: Consider adding runtime validation for required env vars (SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET) rather than failing silently at runtime.

2. **Increase test coverage**: Consider adding integration tests for the Spotify search endpoint with mock responses.

3. **Loading states**: Add loading/pending states to SearchBar while fetching results.

4. **Rate limiting**: The Spotify API has rate limits - consider adding client-side debouncing to prevent excessive requests.

### Summary:
- Replaced Spotify search with Deezer search integration
- Added sample MP3 file to server/samples
- Refactored search route (massive reduction in lines)
- Updated planning documents
- Added .env_example for environment configuration

## Issues Spotted

1. **Binary file in repo**: `server/samples/MusicSample.mp3` (733KB) is now tracked - consider if this is intentional or should be gitignored.

2. **Large documentation diff**: docs/PLAN.md and docs/PLANCHECKLIST.md show major changes - verify changes are properly tracked.

## Suggestions

1. **Verify .gitignore**: Ensure `server/uploads/` is properly gitignored for future file uploads.

2. **Add search provider abstraction**: Consider abstracting the search provider (Spotify/Dezer) to make it swappable.

3. **Sample file strategy**: Decide if samples should be in repo or fetched from external source.

### Summary:
- Added playlist management with drag-and-drop persistence
- Added PlaylistPanel component
- Added PlaylistContext with state management
- Updated tests for playlist functionality

## Issues Spotted

1. **State persistence**: Verify that playlist order is properly persisted across page reloads - check localStorage usage.

2. **No confirmation dialogs**: The UI lacks confirmation dialogs when deleting playlists or tracks.

## Suggestions

1. **Add undo functionality**: Consider adding undo for playlist/track removal actions.

2. **Optimistic updates**: The drag-and-drop could use optimistic UI updates for better UX.

3. **Accessibility**: Ensure drag-and-drop is keyboard accessible.

2. **Multiple component changes**: 12 component files modified - risk of introducing regressions.

## Suggestions

1. **Verify error handling**: Ensure all API error paths are properly tested with mock failures.

2. **Consider component tests**: Add unit tests for individual components if missing.

3. **Theme documentation**: Document the custom Wax theme configuration for future developers.

### Files Modified:
- `shared/types.ts` — added `externalUrl?: string` to Track interface
- `client/src/hooks/usePlayer.ts` — play() now uses externalUrl as Howler src when present
- `client/src/App.tsx` — wired playlist playback, delete handler, filter/sort state
- `client/src/components/PlaylistPanel.tsx` — added onPlay prop, clickable rows, active item highlight
- `client/src/components/TrackList.tsx` — added onDelete prop, delete button for upload rows only
- `client/src/utils/trackFilter.ts` — new: filterAndSortTracks utility (filter + 5 sort modes)
- `client/src/__tests__/TrackList.test.tsx` — updated for new props; added delete button tests
- `client/src/__tests__/trackFilter.test.ts` — new: 7 tests for filter and sort logic
- `server/src/tracks.ts` — added isSampleFilename() helper
- `server/src/routes/tracks.ts` — added DELETE /api/tracks/:filename (403 sample, 404 missing, 204 ok)
- `server/src/__tests__/api.test.ts` — 3 new delete endpoint tests
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` — updated source enum and track shapes from Spotify/YouTube to Deezer
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — added Wax design system entry
- `docs/PLANCHECKLIST.md` — Session 2C marked complete; tsconfig item ticked in 4A

## Issues Spotted

1. **IDs regenerated on every GET /api/tracks**: `tracks.ts` calls `uuidv4()` at read-time, so local track IDs differ between page loads and playlist storage. Playlist "active" detection falls back to filename comparison, which works but means stored playlist item IDs are stale after refresh.

2. **handleDeleteTrack is async but errors are swallowed**: If the DELETE fetch fails, tracks state is still updated and playback stopped. Should surface a failure state.

3. **No confirmation on delete**: Uploaded tracks are deleted immediately on button click with no undo. Easy to delete accidentally.

## Suggestions

1. **Stabilise track IDs**: Generate IDs from filename hash or store them in a lightweight JSON manifest so they are stable across restarts. This will be needed anyway when the DB lands in Phase 3.

2. **Add error feedback on delete failure**: Catch the fetch error and show a transient error message rather than silently failing.

3. **Debounce filter input**: The filter runs on every keystroke via useMemo — acceptable now but worth debouncing if the track list grows large.
