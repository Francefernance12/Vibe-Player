- `server/src/routes/search.ts` - Search route endpoint

### Summary:
- Added Spotify search endpoint with backend route
- Added SearchBar UI component with tests
- Added SearchResults component
- Implemented related TypeScript types

## Issues Spotted

1. **.env file in diff**: The `.env` file shows up in the diff as having changes. This could contain sensitive credentials - verify no secrets are being committed.

2. **Missing error boundary**: The SearchBar component lacks error boundary handling for failed API calls.

## Suggestions

1. **Add environment validation**: Consider adding runtime validation for required env vars (SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET) rather than failing silently at runtime.

2. **Increase test coverage**: Consider adding integration tests for the Spotify search endpoint with mock responses.

3. **Loading states**: Add loading/pending states to SearchBar while fetching results.

4. **Rate limiting**: The Spotify API has rate limits - consider adding client-side debouncing to prevent excessive requests.

### Summary:
- Replaced Spotify search with Deezer search integration
- Added sample MP3 file to server/samples
- Refactored search route (massive reduction in lines)
- Updated planning documents
- Added .env_example for environment configuration

## Issues Spotted

1. **Binary file in repo**: `server/samples/MusicSample.mp3` (733KB) is now tracked - consider if this is intentional or should be gitignored.

2. **Large documentation diff**: docs/PLAN.md and docs/PLANCHECKLIST.md show major changes - verify changes are properly tracked.

## Suggestions

1. **Verify .gitignore**: Ensure `server/uploads/` is properly gitignored for future file uploads.

2. **Add search provider abstraction**: Consider abstracting the search provider (Spotify/Dezer) to make it swappable.

3. **Sample file strategy**: Decide if samples should be in repo or fetched from external source.
