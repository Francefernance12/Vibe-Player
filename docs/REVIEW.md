## Issues Spotted

1. **.env file in diff**: The `.env` file shows up in the diff as having changes. This could contain sensitive credentials - verify no secrets are being committed.

2. **Missing error boundary**: The SearchBar component lacks error boundary handling for failed API calls.

## Suggestions

1. **Add environment validation**: Consider adding runtime validation for required env vars (SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET) rather than failing silently at runtime.

2. **Increase test coverage**: Consider adding integration tests for the Spotify search endpoint with mock responses.

3. **Loading states**: Add loading/pending states to SearchBar while fetching results.

4. **Rate limiting**: The Spotify API has rate limits - consider adding client-side debouncing to prevent excessive requests.
