## Phase 1 — Beta Playback ✅ COMPLETE

### Session 1A — Project Scaffold + Backend API

- ✅ Monorepo structure created (`/client`, `/server`, `/shared`)
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` added to project root
- ✅ Express server scaffolded with basic error handling
- ✅ `GET /api/health` endpoint — returns `{ status: "ok" }`
- ✅ `GET /api/tracks` endpoint — returns list of sample + uploaded tracks
- ✅ `POST /api/tracks/upload` endpoint — accepts audio file, saves to `/server/uploads/`
- ✅ `GET /api/tracks/:filename/stream` endpoint — streams audio file by filename
- ✅ Sample audio files added to `/server/samples/` (sample1.mp3, sample2.mp3, sample3.mp3)
- ✅ Jest + Supertest installed and configured
- ✅ Test: health check returns 200
- ✅ Test: `/api/tracks` returns an array
- ✅ Test: upload returns 201 with track metadata
- ✅ Test: stream endpoint returns correct audio content-type
- ✅ All tests pass: `npm run test:server`
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: `curl localhost:3001/api/health` → `{ status: "ok" }`

---

### Session 1B — Frontend UI + Audio Engine

- ✅ React + TypeScript + Vite scaffolded in `/client`
- ✅ Tailwind CSS installed and configured
- ✅ Howler.js installed (`howler` + `@types/howler`)
- ✅ `TrackList` component — fetches `/api/tracks`, renders list
- ✅ `PlayerControls` component — play/pause, previous/next buttons
- ✅ `ProgressBar` component — current time / duration display, seekable (ref-based, no setState on tick)
- ✅ `VolumeControl` component — volume slider
- ✅ `FileUpload` component — drag-and-drop + click to upload
- ✅ Howler.js wired via `usePlayer` hook to all controls
- ✅ Vite proxy configured (`/api` → `localhost:3001`)
- ✅ Vitest + React Testing Library installed
- ✅ Test: `TrackList` renders correct number of items from mock data

- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Upload MP3 → appears in list → plays with working seek/pause

---

### Session 1C — Polish + Vercel Deployment

- ✅ `vercel.json` configured (client at `/`, API routed via rewrites to `/api/index.ts`)
- ✅ Express wrapped for Vercel serverless compatibility (`api/index.ts` exports app)
- ✅ `/tmp` used for uploads on Vercel; samples bundled via `includeFiles`
- ✅ `.env` (PORT=3001) set up, `.env` confirmed in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Full test suite passes: 5 server + 10 client = 15 tests
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel: `vercel --prod` — https://vibe-player.vercel.app
- ✅ Live URL verified: health check + tracks working
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Live Vercel URL serves the app end-to-end

---

## Phase 2 — External APIs

### ~~Session 2A (Spotify attempt) — SUPERSEDED~~

> Spotify Web API requires the app owner to have an active Premium subscription
> to use the search endpoint. The implementation was correct but the API returns
> 403 regardless of credentials without Premium. All Spotify code was
> removed and replaced with Deezer in the new Session 2A below.

---

### Session 2A — Deezer Search ✅ COMPLETE

> Deezer public API requires no API key, no OAuth, no `.env` variables.
> Search returns track metadata + direct 30-second preview MP3 URLs.

- ✅ Decision entry added to `docs/DECISIONS.md` — Deezer chosen, Spotify blocked
- ✅ `GET /api/search?q=` proxies Deezer, returns normalized `SearchTrack[]`
- ✅ `SearchBar` + `SearchResults` components built and wired
- ✅ `client/src/types.ts` updated — `SearchTrack.source: 'deezer'`
- ✅ Tests pass: search returns 400 without q, correct shape with q
- ✅ Manual smoke test: search returns Deezer tracks
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Search results appear in UI

---

### Session 2B — Playlist Management (Frontend Only) ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `PlaylistContext` created with React context
- ✅ "Add to playlist" button on each track (local + Deezer results)
- ✅ `PlaylistPanel` component with drag-and-drop reordering (`@dnd-kit`)
- ✅ Playlist persisted to `localStorage` with versioned key (`playlist:v1`)
- ✅ All playlist context tests pass (add, remove, reorder, persistence)
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Playlist UI renders and persists

---

### Session 2C — Bug Fixes + Core UX Features ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `externalUrl?: string` added to `Track` in `shared/types.ts` and `client/src/types.ts`
- ✅ `usePlayer.play()` uses `externalUrl` as Howler src when present
- ✅ Deezer preview URLs play correctly via Howler
- ✅ `PlaylistPanel.onPlay` wired — local tracks use API stream; Deezer uses externalUrl
- ✅ `DELETE /api/tracks/:filename` — deletes from uploads/ only, 403 for samples
- ✅ Filter input + sort dropdown (A–Z, Z–A, Size ↑↓, Source) in TrackList
- ✅ 40 tests pass (11 server + 29 client)

---

### Session 2D — Multi-Playlist + UI Polish ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `PlaylistContext` rewritten for multi-playlist support (`playlists:v2` storage key)
- ✅ `createPlaylist(name): string` added; `addLocal` now requires `playlistId`
- ✅ `PlaylistPanel` rewritten: collapsible accordion per playlist, chevron toggle, track count badge
- ✅ "New playlist" inline input with `create` button and Escape-to-cancel
- ✅ DndContext scoped per-playlist accordion section
- ✅ Currently-playing item highlighted with orange dot + animated pulse
- ✅ `TrackList` updated: inline playlist picker expands below each row (grid-rows animation)
- ✅ All tests updated for new multi-playlist API: 42 tests pass (11 server + 31 client)

---

## Phase 3 — Authentication + Database

### Session 3A — Schema Update + SQLite Setup ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `better-sqlite3` + `@types/better-sqlite3` installed in `/server`
- ✅ Migrations 001–003: users, playlists, playlist_tracks
- ✅ Migration runner (`server/db/migrate.ts`) — idempotent
- ✅ `server/db/index.ts` — typed query helpers + `createMemoryDb()` for tests
- ✅ 11 DB tests pass with `:memory:` database

---

### Session 3B — Auth Endpoints ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `bcrypt` + `jsonwebtoken` + `cookie-parser` installed
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me`
- ✅ `authMiddleware` in `server/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- ✅ 9 auth endpoint tests; 34 server tests pass total

---

### Session 3C — Auth UI + Playlist Persistence ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `LoginPage` + `RegisterPage` components
- ✅ `AuthContext` (`user`, `loading`, `login`, `register`, `logout`)
- ✅ `AuthGate` in `App.tsx` — shows login/register when not logged in
- ✅ Playlist CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT /tracks) — all auth-protected
- ✅ Register auto-creates Favorites playlist in DB
- ✅ `PlaylistContext` syncs to API when logged in; falls back to localStorage when not
- ✅ 42 server + 36 client = 78 total tests pass
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Register → build playlist → refresh → playlist still there

---

## Phase 3B — Hotfix: Persistent Database

### Session 5A — SQLite → Turso (libSQL) ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Root cause: Vercel `/tmp` ephemeral per invocation — register and login hit different containers
- ✅ `better-sqlite3` replaced with `@libsql/client` (Turso-hosted remote SQLite)
- ✅ All DB helpers made async; route handlers updated
- ✅ `initDb()` called at startup in both `server/src/index.ts` and `api/index.ts`
- ✅ In-memory libSQL client for tests: `createClient({ url: ':memory:' })`
- ✅ 42 server tests pass
- ✅ **Checkpoint**: Register → log out → log in → succeeds on live Vercel URL

---

## Phase 4 — Polish + Scale

### Session 4A — Performance ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Fixed bottom-sheet player (`react-swipeable` swipe left/right → next/prev)
- ✅ Prev/next touch targets: `p-3 sm:p-2` (~44px on mobile)
- ✅ `ProgressBar` touch support via `onTouchEnd`
- ✅ All 36 client tests pass

---

### Session 4C — Backlog + Architecture Docs ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `docs/PLANCHECKLIST.md` updated: all Phase 6 sessions marked complete
- ✅ `docs/PLAN.md` updated: Phase 6 and 5D marked complete

---

## Phase 5 — Feature Additions

### Session 5B — Upload Persistence (Vercel Blob) ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `@vercel/blob` installed; `multer.memoryStorage()`; `put()` to CDN; `createUploadedTrack` to Turso
- ✅ `DELETE /api/tracks/:id` uses Turso UUID, not filename
- ✅ `GET /api/tracks` auth-aware: adds user's uploads to samples for logged-in users
- ✅ `server/db/migrations/004_create_uploaded_tracks.sql`
- ✅ 45 server tests pass

---

### Session 5C — AI Music Assistant Chatbot (Groq) ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `POST /api/chat` — auth-protected, 5 req/min rate limit, Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- ✅ `useChat` hook — rolling 20-message history, `extractAction` parser
- ✅ `ChatBubble` (fixed FAB) + `ChatWindow` (slide-in panel)
- ✅ Chat actions: `play`, `search`, `add_to_playlist`, `pause`, `resume`, `skip`, `prev`, `set_volume`, `search_and_play`
- ✅ Action feedback rendered as dim italic lines in chat
- ✅ 49 client + 52 server = 101 tests pass

---

### Session 5D — Upload Size Limit + Per-User Quota UI ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ multer `limits: { fileSize: 50MB }`; quota check before `put()`
- ✅ `GET /api/user/quota` → `{ used, limit, tier }`
- ✅ `StorageBar` component — tier badge, progress bar, orange at ≥90%
- ✅ `useQuota` hook — refreshes after upload/delete
- ✅ **Known constraint**: Vercel Hobby caps request bodies at 4.5MB; files >4.5MB still 413 in production

---

## Phase 6 — Playback Modes, Layout Overhaul, Cascade Delete, Extended Chat

### Session 6A — Player Enhancements ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `usePlayer.ts` rewritten: `shuffleRef`, `loopModeRef`, `queueRef`, `currentTrackRef`, `volumeRef`, `playInternalRef` (all `useRef` so Howl `onend` closure sees current values)
- ✅ `play(track, context?)` — sets `queueRef` if context provided; falls back to `libraryTracks` on first play
- ✅ `onend` auto-advance: loop-track restarts, shuffle picks random, linear advances, queue-loop wraps, otherwise stops
- ✅ `toggleShuffle()` / `cycleLoop()` sync refs + `useState` for re-renders
- ✅ Library track click → `player.play(track, visibleTracks)` (filtered library as queue context)
- ✅ Playlist track click → `player.play(track, playlistQueue)` (playlist as queue context)
- ✅ All client tests pass

---

### Session 6B — Desktop Layout Overhaul ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `PlayerBar.tsx` (renamed from MobilePlayerBar): always-visible fixed bottom bar, `max-w-md` width, swipe gestures preserved
- ✅ Shuffle button (orange when active) + Loop cycle button (badge "1" for track-loop mode)
- ✅ `VolumeControl` desktop-only (`hidden sm:flex`)
- ✅ Library / Playlists tab switcher in `App.tsx` (orange underline on active)
- ✅ Removed `hidden sm:flex` embedded desktop player card; padding `pb-28`
- ✅ Temporal dead zone bug fixed: `visibleTracks` useMemo hoisted above `handleSelect`
- ✅ All client tests pass

---

### Session 6C — Cascade Delete + UX Polish ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `removeTrackFromAllPlaylists(trackId)` in `PlaylistContext`; called from `handleDeleteTrack`
- ✅ Deezer tracks persisted to `localStorage` (`deezer-library-tracks` key); survive page refresh
- ✅ `Tooltip.tsx` — mouse-following via `onMouseMove`, `bottom` anchor (no transform conflict), `matchMedia` hover detection
- ✅ `TrackList.tsx` — `⋮` mobile button (portal menu: Info / Add to playlist / Delete); `InfoBottomSheet`; desktop `+`/trash `hidden sm:flex`
- ✅ `PlaylistPanel.tsx` — per-playlist filter + sort dropdown; DnD disabled when filter active
- ✅ 49 client + 52 server tests pass

---

### Session feature/pricing-mockup — Mockup Pricing Page ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `PricingPage.tsx` — full-screen portal overlay; 3 tiers (Free / Pro / Max); all CTAs disabled
- ✅ Diagonal "MOCKUP" watermark (Cormorant Garamond, semi-transparent)
- ✅ Sticky amber banner: "MOCKUP ONLY — no payment is processed"
- ✅ "Plans" button in app header → `showPricing` state
- ✅ Cormorant Garamond font added to `client/index.html`

---

## Phase 7 — Optimization & Code Quality

### Session 7A — Frontend Performance Audit ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `useChat.ts` — stale closure fix: `messagesRef` + `isLoadingRef` added; `sendMessage` reads/writes via refs; `messages`/`isLoading` removed from dep array; `clearMessages` clears ref
- ✅ `Tooltip.tsx` — replaced `pos` useState (60fps setState) with `posRef` + direct `cardRef.current.style` writes; `visible` boolean retained for show/hide
- ✅ `PlaylistContext.tsx` — `reorderPlaylist` PUT debounced 400ms (`reorderDebounceRef`); state update remains immediate (optimistic)
- ✅ `PlayerBar.tsx` — wrapped with `React.memo`
- ✅ `ProgressBar.tsx` — wrapped with `React.memo`
- ✅ `SearchBar.tsx` — `onSearching` added to `useEffect` dep array (was missing)
- ✅ 49 client + 52 server tests pass; bundle 105 kB gzip

---

### Session 7B — Backend Performance Audit ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `server/db/migrations/005_add_indexes.sql` — `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` for `playlists(user_id)`, `playlist_tracks(playlist_id)`, `uploaded_tracks(user_id)`
- ✅ `server/db/migrate.ts` — `db.execute` → `db.executeMultiple` so multi-statement migration files run correctly
- ✅ `server/db/index.ts` — `getPlaylistsWithTracks` helper via single LEFT JOIN; `PlaylistWithTracks` interface exported
- ✅ `server/src/routes/playlists.ts` — `GET /api/playlists` N+1 `Promise.all` replaced with single `getPlaylistsWithTracks` call
- ✅ `server/db/index.ts` `replacePlaylistTracks` — accurate docstring confirming `db.batch('write')` is atomic; manual `BEGIN/COMMIT` must not be added
- ✅ `server/src/middleware/auth.ts` — fast-path exit intent + `getJwtSecret()` fail-fast comments
- ✅ `server/src/routes/chat.ts` — MemoryStore cold-start reset comment
- ✅ `server/src/routes/tracks.ts` — per-request freshness comment for `getUserUploadedBytes`
- ✅ 52 server tests pass

---

### Session 7C — Code Quality Pass + Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ `server/src/routes/tracks.ts` — `Buffer.from(originalname, 'latin1').toString('utf8')` fixes non-ASCII upload filenames (Japanese, Chinese, etc.) garbled by busboy's default Latin-1 decoding
- ✅ `server/src/__tests__/tracks.test.ts` — 2 new encoding tests: ASCII round-trip unchanged; Japanese katakana recovered from garbled latin1 bytes
- ✅ Dead code removed: `UPLOADS_DIR` (tracks.ts), `getPlaylistTrackById` (db/index.ts), `PlayerState`/`PlayerControls` interfaces (usePlayer.ts), `PlayerBarProps` made module-private
- ✅ Type consolidation: `SearchTrack` moved to `shared/types.ts`; `client/src/types.ts` converted to re-export barrel; decision documented in `DECISIONS.md`
- ✅ Error handling: `handleDeleteTrack` in `App.tsx` now guards fetch failure — local state only mutated on confirmed server deletion
- ✅ Accessibility: `⋮` button gets `aria-haspopup="menu"` + `aria-expanded`; filter inputs and new-playlist input get `aria-label`
- ✅ No console noise or `any` types found in production paths
- ✅ 49 client + 54 server = 103 tests pass
